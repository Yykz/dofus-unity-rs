This library provides a Rust implementation of the Dofus Unity protocol. The .proto files necessary to generate this implementation come from [proto-gen](../proto-gen).

## [Docs](https://yykz.github.io/dofus-unity-rs/dofus_protocol)

## Prerequisites
- **Protocol Buffers Compiler (protoc)**: The protoc compiler must be [installed](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf?tab=readme-ov-file#protobuf-compiler-installation) and available in your system's PATH.
- **Well-Known Types**: Ensure that the well-known types provided by Google are available in the protoc include path.
